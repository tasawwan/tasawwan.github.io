I am a second year PLME (Program in Liberal Medical Education) student at Brown concentrating in Computational Biology (Sc.B.) and History (A.B.).

I am super interested in doing translational research with a focus on neuropsychiatric disorders. I am also passionate about public policy and and aim to make a difference.

At the Larschan and O'Connor Giles Labs, I research gene regulation of synaptogensis in fly larvae. I work closely under the direction of my mentor, [James Kentro](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Kentro), a doctoral candidate.

Before Brown, I graduated salutatorian from the International Academy in Bloomfield Hills. I also worked as a research intern at the Detroit Trauma Project where I worked under the mentorship of [Dr. Ana√Øs Stenson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anais-stenson-13087525a/).

Outside of research, I am an avid naturalist who loves to backpack, ski, and row. I am currently one of the leaders of the Brown Outing Club and Brown Outdoor Leadership Training and I strongly believe the outdoors can teach us life's most important lessons!
